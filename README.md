 A Spatial and Socio-Economic Analysis of MTA Bus Violations
</div>

## Project Overview

<div align='center'>
At the start of 2019, the MTA introduced a new technology with efforts to speed of bus routes in the NYC boroughs. The Bus Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) system was implemented onto specific buses, eventually spreading onto buses across the five boroughs.

### Business Problem
Bus lines are consistently slowed by bus lane obstructions, which affect bus efficiency and cause delays. For this reason, the ACE system has been a driving force in waning these issues.
<br>
<br>
Since its inception, there have been over 3 million violations issued, with their implications embedded inside the data. Our team aimed to bring forth these implications, especially in regards to their impact on people and communities.
<br>
<br>
With this goal in mind, this lead our team to 3 overarching questions:
</div>

1. What are the key characteristics of violation hotspots?

2. What are the impacts of repeat offenders on violation rates?

3. Is there a connection between violation frequency and the socio-economic factors of their corresponding bus stops?

## Overview of Database & Schema
This project utilizes a **single, comprehensive table** named `enforcement_violations`. This "flat file" structure contains detailed records for each enforcement event, whether it resulted in a violation or not. This design allows for flexible aggregation and analysis across multiple dimensions like time, location, and vehicle behavior.
  * The data is captured at the level of a single enforcement event, uniquely identified by `violation_ID`.
  * Analysis is conducted by grouping and filtering on key descriptive columns like `bus_route_ID`, `stop_name`, `violation_status`, and `violation_type`.
### Key Columns Overview
  * `vehicle_ID`: A unique identifier for each vehicle.
  * `bus_route_ID`: The bus route on which the event occurred.
  * `stop_name`: The name of the nearest bus stop.
  * `first_occurrence`: The timestamp of the enforcement event.
  * `violation_status`: The outcome of the event (e.g., 'VIOLATION ISSUED', 'EXEMPT', 'TECHNICAL ISSUE/OTHER').
  * `violation_type`: The specific category of the violation (e.g., 'Bus Lane Violation').
  * `bus_stop_latitude`, `bus_stop_longitude`: Geographic coordinates of the bus stop.
-----
## EDA (SQL)
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to establish a baseline understanding of the enforcement landscape. Three key areas were investigated:
1.  **Violation Status Distribution:** We analyzed the different outcomes of enforcement events. While 'VIOLATION ISSUED' was the most common, a significant number were logged as 'EXEMPT' or 'TECHNICAL ISSUE/OTHER', highlighting the need to filter for issued violations to analyze true offender behavior.
2.  **Geographic Hotspots:** We ran an initial aggregation of violations by bus stop. The analysis immediately revealed a highly skewed distribution: a small number of bus stops are responsible for a disproportionately large number of total violations, confirming the "hotspot" theory.
3.  **Repeat Offender Prevalence:** We performed an initial calculation on repeat vehicles and found that a substantial percentage of vehicles receive more than one ticket. This confirmed that targeting repeat offenders is a viable and potentially high-impact strategy.
-----
## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (SQL)
To prepare the data for deep analysis, critical cleaning and feature engineering steps were performed.
### Data Cleaning
The primary data quality issue was the non-standard date format.
  * **Parsing Timestamps:** The `first_occurrence` column was stored as text in the format `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS PM`. We used `SUBSTR()` functions to parse and reformat this text into a standard `YYYY-MM-DD` format that SQLite's date functions could process.

### Feature Engineering

New features were created to unlock temporal and behavioral insights:
  * `day_type`: Categorized timestamps into 'Weekday' or 'Weekend'. Rationale: To analyze if violation patterns differ between workdays and weekends.
  * `hour_of_day`: Extracted the hour from the timestamp. Rationale: To identify peak violation times for targeted deployment.
  * `days_since_last_violation`: Calculated the time gap between a vehicle's consecutive violations. Rationale: To quantify the "recidivism rate" and understand offender habits.
-----
## CTEs & Window Functions (SQL)
Advanced SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions were essential for uncovering complex patterns.
1.  **Dominant Violation by Route:** We used `ROW_NUMBER()` to find the single most common violation type for every bus route, revealing route-specific challenges.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        bus_route_ID,
        violation_type,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY bus_route_ID ORDER BY COUNT(violation_ID) DESC) as rn
    FROM enforcement_violations
    ```
2.  **Recidivism Rate Analysis:** We used `LAG()` to access the date of a vehicle's previous violation, allowing us to calculate the average time it takes for an offender to get another ticket.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        violation_date,
        LAG(violation_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_ID ORDER BY violation_date) AS previous_violation_date
    FROM FormattedViolations
    ```

Figure 1: Proportion of Repeat vs. One-Time Offenders (12-Month Period): This chart establishes the scale of the recidivism problem, showing that over one-third (37.6%) of all vehicles receiving a ticket will receive at least one more within a year. This confirms that a substantial portion of violations are caused by a core group of chronic offenders, making them a high-value target for focused enforcement strategies.

Figure 2: Dominant Violation Type for Each Bus Route: This chart provides the core strategic insight for route-level enforcement by color-coding the top bus routes by their primary enforcement challenge. It clearly demonstrates that different routes face different problemsâ€”for example, the M15+ is overwhelmingly dominated by bus lane violations, while the BX19's main issue is vehicles stopped at bus stops. This proves the need for route-specific, rather than city-wide, intervention strategies.

Figure 3: Peak Violation Hours (Weekday vs. Weekend): This time-series analysis reveals the city's "violation rhythm." The weekday trend (top) shows two sharp peaks corresponding to the morning (8-9 AM) and evening (3-5 PM) commutes, identifying clear windows for targeted enforcement. The weekend trend (bottom) displays a single, broader peak in the afternoon, requiring a different staffing and deployment strategy.

Figure 4: Average Time to Next Violation (Recidivism Rate): This chart quantifies how quickly repeat offenders receive another ticket, broken down by the type of their subsequent violation. It reveals that vehicles ticketed for a 'MOBILE BUS STOP' violation re-offend the fastest, on average. This insight into offender behavior can be used to tailor deterrent strategies and penalty structures for different types of infractions.

Figure 5: Top 10 Bus Routes by Reported Technical Issues: This chart moves beyond driver behavior to identify routes with potential equipment or system reliability problems. The M15+ route reports a disproportionately high number of technical issues compared to all others, suggesting an urgent need for a maintenance audit on its specific enforcement cameras or bus-mounted equipment to ensure data integrity and program effectiveness.

## Insights & Recommendations
### For the Director of NYC Transit
  * **Insight:** Bus lane enforcement is not a uniform problem; it is a series of distinct, predictable challenges concentrated in specific locations, times, and routes. A small group of repeat offenders causes a disproportionate impact.
  * **Recommendation:** **Champion a shift from a volume-based to a targeted, data-driven enforcement model.** Frame this as a strategic initiative to directly improve bus speeds and service reliability, using the "Top 10 Hotspots" as a pilot program to prove effectiveness.
### For the Director of Enforcement Operations
  * **Insight:** Violations are highly predictable. The top 10 bus stops account for a massive portion of all tickets, and peak violation times are consistent. Furthermore, certain routes and vehicles show a high rate of 'Technical Issue' logs, suggesting potential equipment failure.
  * **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Deploy Resources Surgically:** Reallocate enforcement teams to the **Top 10 Hotspots** identified on the map, specifically during the **peak weekday hours** (8-10 AM, 4-6 PM).
    2.  **Target "Super Offenders":** Use the list of top 5% repeat offenders to create a high-priority monitoring list for intervention.
    3.  **Conduct an Equipment Audit:** Launch an investigation into the vehicles and routes with the highest number of 'Technical Issue' logs to ensure camera and system reliability.
### For the Director of Transit Planning
  * **Insight:** The *type* of violation is not random but strongly correlated with the bus route. This suggests that enforcement issues are often symptoms of underlying environmental or infrastructural problems.
  * **Recommendations:**
    1.  **Inform Infrastructure Redesigns:** For routes where 'Bus Lane Violation' is the dominant issue (e.g., M15), use this data to advocate for physical redesigns like protected, red-painted lanes or curb extensions that make incursions more difficult.
    2.  **Review Curbside Policy:** For routes dominated by 'Parking at Bus Stop' or 'Double Parking' violations, partner with the Department of Transportation to review parking regulations, signage clarity, and loading zone policies near the identified hotspot stops.
-----
## Ethics & Bias
  * **Data Quality:** The primary data cleaning challenge was parsing non-standard text-based timestamps. All conversion logic is documented.
  * **Missing Values:** A small percentage of records with `NULL` for `vehicle_id` and `bus_stop_id` were excluded which could slightly underrepresent violations in those areas.
  * **Time Window:** This analysis is based on a specific dataset time frame (2019 - 2024). The findings are highly relevant but should be re-validated with data from different years to check for patterns.
  * **No Severity Modeled:** The analysis treats all issued violations equally. It does not account for the duration or severity of the obstruction, which is a limitation when assessing the true impact on bus service.
